LDB-415 - Rollback Script for Consolidate

User Story
----------
As a system administrator
I want a rollback script to return to the original consolidate
So that I can recover the system in case of unresolved issues with the new consolidate from SummaryProc.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
-----------------------------
1. Script availability
   Given the consolidateGroup summary has been launched
   When a rollback is required
   Then the script must be available to execute and restore the original consolidate.

2. Data correction
   Given the script execution starts
   When it reviews HIST_ADDRESS.TS_EXPIRE from the earliest date to the last consolidated day
   Then it must add missing final states and update HIST_ADDRESS records as finalized, consolidated, and summarized.

3. Schema validation
   Given the script is executed
   When the schema is not healthy
   Then missing summary days must be rebuilt before proceeding with rollback.

4. Statistics rebuild
   Given the rollback process is complete
   When the interval days are defined (e.g., daysToConsolidate = 3)
   Then statistics for the corresponding days prior to the change must be rebuilt.

Non-functional Criteria
-----------------------
- The rollback process must ensure data integrity and consistency across HIST_ADDRESS and HIST_STATUS_DETAIL.
- The solution must not degrade the normal performance of ongoing consolidate processes.
- The rollback script must comply with internal standards for production environments.
