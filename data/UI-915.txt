HU-XX - Hide and restrict the option to unlink customer objects

User Story
----------
As a user graphic LIMSP
I want the option to unlink customer objects to be hidden and protected
So that accidental unlinks of critical data are prevented.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
-----------------------------
1. Initial disabled state
   Given a user accesses the customer objects list
   When the unlink icons are displayed
   Then these should appear disabled by default.

2. Enabling from the menu
   Given a user wants to enable the unlink option
   When they open the three-dots menu and select “Allow unlinking objects”
   Then the unlink icons in the list will be enabled.

3. Warning with object reference
   Given a user selects the action to unlink an object
   When the warning message is displayed
   Then it must show the unique reference of the object to be unlinked
   And must include a mandatory confirmation checkbox before executing the action.

4. Mandatory confirmation
   Given a user sees the warning message
   When the confirmation checkbox is not checked
   Then the unlink action cannot be completed.

Non-functional Criteria
-----------------------
- The confirmation must be clear, visible, and mandatory.
- The change must not affect the performance of the object list visualization.
- It must comply with the company’s security policies (prevention of accidental critical operations).
